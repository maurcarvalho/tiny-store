## Current Documentation

For current, up-to-date documentation, see:
- `/README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture decisions and patterns
- `/docs/API.md` - API endpoint reference
- `/docs/EVENT_FLOWS.md` - Event choreography and flows
- `/docs/TESTING.md` - Testing guide and strategies
- `/libs/shared/testing/E2E_HELPERS.md` - E2E helpers library documentation

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during development to track progress, plan improvements, and document implementation decisions. They remain valuable for:
- Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- Learning about design decisions
- Reference for similar future improvements

However, they are not needed for day-to-day development, so they've been archived to keep the root directory clean.
